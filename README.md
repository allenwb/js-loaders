# js-loaders

Pseudoimplementation of the proposed ES6 module loaders.

My goal is to evolve this into a usable self-hosted implementation of
the proposed Loader API.

That's a long-term goal.

The code in loaders.js is full of syntax errors and comments recording
open issues in the design. (These open issues are mostly minor to
trivial from the user's perspective, though perhaps not from the
implementor's perspective.)
